1. learn pthread iterface

3. create a double linked locked list with iterators, each node has a lock.
4. create logging functions "candidate chosen","element removed"

5. create one thread walk algorithm

6create main program:
getting params
creating list,
cloning T times and performing the algorithm on a given list.

7 create a ton of tests:




- test correct printing for one thread for varying Ns

- have 2 threads print conflicts/waiting prints

- massive rand test, grep strings from logger files
