* Before you run the tests, make sure to unload the module srandom
and remove /dev/srandom. This is done to assure consistent outputs.

* The directories tests and utils should be put with srandom.o

* If you change the utils .c files, you'll get different output

* To run the tests:

$ cd utils
$ make
$ cd ../tests
$ ./test1.sh > myout
$ ./test2.sh
